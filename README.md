Kata statement : https://gist.github.com/abachar/d20bdcd07dac589feef8ef21b487648c

Coding approach: 

 We used the TDD (Test Driven Development) to undertake this kata. The TDD is an agile approach of developing. It consists on:
 
 1 - Writing the unit test and running it to make sure that it fails
 
 2 - Writing the corresponding code and running test to verify that it passes
 
 3 - Refactoring the code and running the test again to check that there is not a regression
