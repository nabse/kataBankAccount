Kata statement : https://gist.github.com/abachar/d20bdcd07dac589feef8ef21b487648c

Coding approach: 

 We used the TDD (Test Driven Development) to undertake this kata. The TDD is an agile approach of developing. It consists on:
 
 1 - Write the unit test and run it to make sure that it fails
 2 - Write the corresponding code and run test to verify that it passes
 3 - Refactor the code and run the test again to check that there is not a regression
